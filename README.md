# restaurant-page


This sample bakery page was created to practice using Webpack and completely generate a webpage without hard-coding any html.


Reflection: I think this project was fairly straightforward except for getting Webpack 5 to work at times.
The documentation for fonts is incorrect and the format('') actually prevented it from working. 
I managed to fix it by random chance. I think tab2gen could've condensed, but putting the text values into the array then making a for loop didn't work.
